This is just a simple wacked out intro for phaser.js using tweens, animations and physics to make things do what they do! the word PHASER falls from the sky rotating 1260 degrees and landing upside down with a png image of a car going across the screen leaving a smoketrail with a bunch of magical pandas falling from the skying with defferent scales in size trying to take over the world. Also one panda follows your mouse when you move it :) its a lil weird.. but so cool..
